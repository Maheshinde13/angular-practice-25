<!-- Build a traffic light where the lights switch from green to yellow to red after predetermined intervals and loop indefinitely. Each light should be lit for the following durations:

Red light: 4000ms
Yellow light: 500ms
Green light: 3000ms
You are free to exercise your creativity to style the appearance of the traffic light. -->
